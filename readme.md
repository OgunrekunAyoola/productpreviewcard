## Overview
This is a product preview card

### The challenge
The challenge is to build  product review card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


## My process
1. I initialized my project a a public repository on Github.This is because creatimg a repository will make it easier to share my code with the community.

2. I configured my repository to publish my code to a web adress.

3. I looked through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me to think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

4. I structured my content with HTML before adding any styles and this helped me focus my attention on creating well-structured content.

5. I wrote the base styles for my priject, including general content styles, such as font-family and font-size.

6. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. I Only moved to the next section once i was done with the area i was working on.
